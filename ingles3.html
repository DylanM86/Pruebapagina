    6 Simple principles to build peace in your community
    If you switch on the TV news, open the newspaper or click
    onto a popular news website, there’s always news about a
    terrorist attack, war, ongoing conflict and a general lack of
    peace amongst different groups of people. In an
    increasingly globalised world, we should understand each
    other better, stand ever more united and strive for peace.
    Sadly, the truth is quite the opposite. There’s conflict in
    Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, all over
    the world in fact…<br>
    As individuals and citizens, how do we deal with this? How
    does this relate to us? How can we make positive changes
    to enable us to live in peace? <br> <br>


    RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE
    WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED <br> <br>
    The good old Golden Rule says it all: 
    empathy, tolerance and peace. This
    principle teaches you to love yourself
    and love others. It spans cultures and
    faiths and is a universal age old
    concept which can’t fail! <br> <br>

    RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY,
NOT TO SPEAK <br> <br>
Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to
others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and
build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be
established if people are unable to communicate with others; to
listen to their experiences and views and show empathy,
understanding and compassion. <br> <br>



RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION <br> <br>
We all have different opinions and we may not all
agree on the same things. Building compromise and
mutual understanding is incredibly important. <br>

Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and
recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of
expression other than our own. <br> <br>

RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH
VIOLENCE <br> <br>
Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be
brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and

forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone
who is violent and therefore continue the vicious
cycle. This does not change anything. <br> <br>

RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID  <br> <br>
Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity
comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic
origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change,
taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we
learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a
different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box.
Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.
them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with
unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly
divisive and unproductive. <br> <br>



RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES  <br> <br>
Take people for the individuals they
are. Avoid misconceptions,
stereotypes and toxic narratives and
get to know a person instead. This
will avoid offence,
misunderstandings and ultimately
help you to create a real bond with
others based on true understanding,
empathy and trust. After all, no one
likes to be judged – especially from
the outside <br> <br>
